# Weather App

Java-based weather app that retrieves temperature, humidity and windspeed for any location in real time.

The project has helped build my back-end development skills and displayed:

GUI Implementation: Using Java Swing, a visually pleasing interface was made to display the location's weather data.
API Integration: Accurate weather data was fetched from Open-Meteo's API via Java's HttpURLConnection
Data Handling: JSON Simple was leveraged to efficiently parse and handle JSON data
